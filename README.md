# classifierpromax

classifierpromax is a scikit-learn wrapper library that helps to train and optimize multiple classifier models in parallel.

`classifier_trainer()`:
This function trains four classifier models using default hyperparameter values. These are used as a baseline for model performance.

`feature_selector()`:
This function will perform feature selection on all input models.

`classifier_optimizer()`:
This function will perform hyperparameter optimization on all input models.

`results_handler()`:
This function will score all the input models based on the criteria specified and visualize the results.
In a machine learning pipeline, code can often be repeated when working with multiple models, violating the DRY (Donâ€™t-Repeat-Yourself) principle. This Python library is to promote DRY principles in machine learning code and create cleaner code.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install classifierpromax
```

## Usage
1. Training baseline models
```python
from classifierpromax import classifier_trainer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X, y = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Function will return a dictionary of models
baseline_models, baseline_score = classifier_trainer(StandardScaler(), X, y, pos_label=1, seed=123)
```
2. Feature selection
```python
from classifierpromax import feature_selector

# Function will return a dictionary of models
fs_models= feature_selector(baseline_models, 'RFE')
```
3. Hyperparameter optimization
```python
from classifierpromax import classifier_optimizer

score = "f1"

# Function will return a dictionary of models
opt_models, opt_score = classifier_optimizer(fs_models, X, y, score)
```
4. Results summary
```python
from classifierpromax import results_handler

# Function will score the models and return a summary table
summary = results_handler(opt_score)
```
